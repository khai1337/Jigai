ISP Employee: Hello, how may we help you? This is Sarah.
You: Hey Sarah, this is Tom, I actually work for this ISP myself and I was
wondering if you could look up a customer in one of our tools for me. My tool is
being extremely buggy and my internet is down for some reason. I don’t need
much, the customer contacted me via support chat and I need a number to call him
back and a name. I can look up the rest in one of our tools.
ISP Employee: Sorry to hear that. Here, let me just look up the IP in our master
tool. One moment please.
*Few moments later*
Alright, here is the client’s phone number associated with the IP address and their
full name. Is that all?
You: Yes ma’am. Thanks Sarah. Have a great shift.
That’s usually all it takes. ISP doxing can either be really simple like that (ISP
doxed a Comcast IP a few weeks ago, got last four of SSN) or really complicated
(failed at doxing a TWC ISP a few days ago, took like four tries). It’s best if you
have a reasonable deep voice and sound believable (more eWhore coaching). All it
takes it practice and the right knowledge of tools to SE some live support.
Tip X3: If you fail on one person, don’t sweat it. Just wait a few minutes or hours
and try with a different support member. Some ISPs are really hard to SE while
some are insanely easy.
Tip X4: Here are a list of ISP tools. Yes, these are tools that you may have access
to because ISP doxing itself is generally public and I doubt that you haven’t heard
of it. Either way, these are necessary tools and information for when you’re ISP
doxing someone. They make ISP doxing a lot easier.
